								<h3>Smart Logistics for Quality Food during Pademic Crisis</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/smart.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The conventional method of checking the safety and freshness of goods (fruits and vegetables) is done manually by a person during the loading and unloading process. In this real-time monitoring system, the goods are monitored using sensors. Temperature, photoresistor and ultrasonic sensors are used to gather information about the freshness of the product.  The NodeMCU module in the model sends data given by the sensors to the cloud and then sends alerts to a phone/computer for remote monitoring in transit. This system can keep check the goods from being damaged or rotten during transportation. There were several instances in which, stale food was delivered to the restaurants and several people got infected. This system could be monitored by the health department to avoid decayed food consumption by the consumers.

								<h3>IoT Based Auto-Disinfectant Sprinkler System for Large Enclosed Space</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/dis.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>COVID-19 created the necessity of sanitizing every corner to keep life secured. In conventional means, sanitization is handled by sprinklers in a variety of shapes and sizes. These sprinklers are either human controlled or machine controlled and does the job by placing them on the floor. The conventional sprinkling system is risky and exerts tremendous pressure on the working personnel; also, it does not assure of covering the entire space intended-for. The proposed auto-sprinkler overcomes these limitations by attaching it to the roof/ceiling and performs the process of sprinkling the disinfectant solution in mist form while being rotated at a 360 degree angle to ensure more coverage. The sprinkling distance is measured automatically using ultrasonic sensor. The Wi-Fi module in the system gets the data inputs from a website where the admin user can enter the start/stop time and duration of the spray. This system keeps a strict check on whether the place is sanitized or not and gives an alert notification if it has been a long time since the last sanitization took place. The prototype was tested and found to be very useful during the Covid-19 pandemic.

								<h3>A Futuristic Approach for Stroke Rehabilitation Using Smart Gloves</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/stroke.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Stroke is a serious, common, and assured as a global health issue across the globe. Stroke is one of most common cause of death and is a leading cause of impairment in adults. Despite all impressive progression and development in the treatment of stroke, without effective modes of care most stroke patients care will continue to rely on physiotherapy involvement. The purpose of this paper is to explain about a new and better device which helps patients affected by stroke who are not able to move their hands. To rehabilitate stroke survivors, the proposed prototype is designed such that it is a portable smart glove which helps users to regain their muscle memory by continuously contracting and releasing their muscles without the involvement of physiotherapist. This device/glove also consists of sensors that collect and send data to UI using ESP32. This UI is available for the doctors to see the statistics of glove usage and monitors the patient. The Glove uses a soft robotics approach to replicate the human hand. The Glove initially aims to contract and release all the muscles in the hand in regular intervals of time. This muscle movement aims to build lost muscle memory. To know more about this project, click <a href="https://github.com/AghilThamizh/stroke-rehab-gloves">here.</a></p>
								
								<h3>Vaccine Monitoring using Localized Backend Communication with Rest and Self-Hosted API</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/vaccine.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>In real-world application, projects using public and open-source API will not suffice the needs of a private organization and its security is questionable. To overcome this, creating a local hosted API to store data is more secure as it is not connected to the internet. Also gives us flexibility and reliability compared to an open-source environment.

								<h3>Yagi-Long Range Antenna</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/yagi.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>This antenna will extend the range of your Wi-Fi or 2.4GHz devices (like surveillance cameras) into many miles and kilometers. A Yagi antenna is basically a telescope for radio waves. The Yagi antenna has 20 parasitic elements. This ensures it has a long-range communication , although having a long-range communication does sacrifice on beam width. We have used a 20mm stainless steel boom, 3mm stainless steel parasitic elements, 6mm stainless steel reflector element and a 3mm copper tube for the dipole. We calculated the values to get all the position for all the elements of the antenna.

								<h3>Prevention of Side Pulling Using AWS Cloud and OpenCV</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/sidepull.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>To reduce the accidents that occurs because of side pulling we have come up with a method to warn the crane handler and the people nearby. This device will have a Node camera attached to it using which photos of the surface below the hoist will be taken each second. And each time a photo is taken it will be sent to the cloud. In the cloud, using OpenCV we will detect the occurrence of side pulling if it happens. To detect this, we will be applying machine learning algorithms in OpenCV. If a side pulling is detected, a message is instantaneously sent to the crane handler from the cloud and a buzzer beep to warn the people nearby.

								<h3>Implementing Tree Topology in ESP32 and Reducing Load in Routes of a Network for Blood Banks</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/esppro.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The unit which administers and manages the requisition and distribution of the blood is named as a blood bank. The main objectives of the blood bank is to provide blood to the patients with minimal blood transfusion error. Blood is a very important medical supply so it should be managed well. As the blood bank management consists of several manual steps, therefore it will become difficult for the blood banks to provide a high level of accuracy, reliability, automation in blood storage and transfusion process. The system proposed is divided into three segments, the first segment consists of Temperature sensor, IR sensor nodes which is installed in rack of blood bank, and the GSM Module for sending request of blood to the donors and to blood banks so that all these are interfaced with Arduino Mega. Second segment consists of Wi-Fi module for data transfer to the server and third segment is used to display the status of available blood stock. The real-time status of blood stock of the blood bank is displayed on web page, so that the blood seekers can get the blood from their nearest blood bank.

								<h3>Identification of Improvement Potentials to Promote Sustainability of Energy  Efficiency to Outdated Cutting Machine Tools</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/cnc.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>When we are using existing machine tools we don't know when a drill bit will wear off or not so if a process is going on and the drill wears off, we must stop the process and start it again with new bit for the same material so waste of time waste of energy and waste of material. We develop an ML algorithm to rectify this error in real time. To know more about this project, click <a href="https://github.com/AghilThamizh/cnc-tool-prediction">here.</a></p>
								
								<h3>E-Commerce Platform Management</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/ecommerce.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>In this modern era of online shopping no seller wants to be left behind, moreover due to its simplicity the shift from offline selling model to an online selling model is witnessing a rampant growth. This significant change in business model is witnessing tremendous growth around the globe and India is not an exception. A massive internet penetration has added to growth of E-commerce and more particularly start-ups have been increasingly using this option as a differentiating business model. Moreover, E-Commerce has significant influences on the environment. Although the model is highly used in current business scenarios, the option has not been explored at its fullest. Therefore, as an engineer our job is to ease the path of this transition for the seller. Amongst many things that an online site requires the most important is a database system. Hence, in this project we designed a database where small clothing sellers can sell their product online.
